# Pomodoro App

The Pomodoro App is a React Native application that helps you manage your time using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- Switches between focus and break sessions automatically.
- Visual indication of the current session (focus or break).
- Countdown timer showing the remaining time for the current session.


## Installation


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/utk145/RN-Pomodoro-App.git
  cd RN-Pomodoro-App
  npm install
  expo-cli start --tunnel
  Scan the qr-code with expo-go app
```


## Customization
You can customize the duration of the focus and break sessions by modifying the `focus_time_in_minutes` and `break_time_in_minutes` constants in the App.tsx file.
Feel free to modify the styling of the app in the styles object in the App.tsx file to suit your preferences.
